This file is automatically\\ngenerated by Python to improve performance.

Thus, if you change\\nthe value of the parameter within a function, the change is reflected in the calling function. We can even observe the pass “by\\nvalue” kind of behavior whenever we pass the arguments to functions that are of type say numbers, strings, tuples. This is\\nbecause of the immutable nature of them.\\n\n",

What is the function of a negative index?\\n  Answer: The sequences in python are indexed and it consists of the positive as well as negative numbers. The numbers that\\nare positive uses ‘0’ that is used as the first index and ‘1’ as the second index and the process goes on like that. The index for\\nthe negative number starts from ‘-1’ that represents the last index in the sequence and ‘-2’ as the penultimate index and the\\nsequence carries forward like the positive number. The negative index is used to remove any new-line spaces from the string\\nand allow the string to except the last character that is given as S[:-1]. The negative index is also used to show the index to\\nrepresent the string in the correct order.\\nWrite a program to check whether the object is of a class or its subclass.\\nThere is a method which is built-in to show the instances of an object that consists of many classes by providing a tuple in a\\ntable instead of individual classes. The method is given as isinstance(obj,cls) and in more details given as:\\nisinstance(obj, (class1, class2, ...)) that is used to check about the object's presence in one of the classes. The built in types\\ncan also have many formats of the same function like isinstance(obj, str) or isinstance(obj, (int, long, float, complex)).\\nIt is not preferred to use the class instead of user-defined classes are made that allow easy object-oriented style to define the\\nbehavior of the object's class. These perform a different thing that is based on the class. The function differs from one class\\nto another class.\\nTo find out the object of the particular class the following program is used:\\n\\ndef search(obj):\\nif isinstance(obj, box):\\n# This is the code that is given for the box and writes the program in the object\\nelif isinstance(obj, Document):\\n# This is the code that searches the document and writes the values in it\\nelif\\nobj.search()\\n#This is the function used to search the object's class.\\n\n",

In most of the object-oriented programming\\nlanguage, this is passed as to the methods as a hidden parameter that is defined by an object. But, in python, it is declared it\\nand pass it explicitly. It is the first argument that gets created in the instance of class A and the parameters to the methods\\nare passed automatically. It refers to a separate instance of the variable for individual objects. This is the first argument that\\nis used in the class instance and the “self” method is defined explicitly to all the methods that are used and present.

The deadlock\\noccurs due to the fact that parent and child don’t have the synchronization and both are waiting to get the processor to\\nprovide the resources to one another. Use of popen3() method allows the reading of stdout and stderr to take place where\\nthe internal buffer increases and there is no read() takes place to share the resources. popen2() take care of the deadlock by\\nproviding the methods like wait() and waitpid() that finishes a process first and when a request comes it hands over the\\nresponsibility to the process that is waiting for the resources.\\nThe program is used to show the process and run it.\\nimport popen2\\nfromchild, tochild = popen2.popen2(“command”)\\ntochild.write(“inputn”)\\ntochild.flush()\\noutput = fromchild.readline()\\nTop 54 Python Interview Questions And Answers For Experienced\\n\n",

What are the different ways to generate random numbers?\\n                                                                                Answer: The random module is the standard module that is used to generate a random number.\\nThe method is defined as:\\nimport random\\n.random()\\nThe statement random.random() method return the floating point number that is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates\\nrandom float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the hidden instances.\\nThe instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading programs that create a different instance of individual\\nthreads. The other random generators that are used in this are:\\n— randrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and defines the range in-between [a, b). It returns the elements by selecting them\\nrandomly from the range that is specified. It doesn't build a range object.\\n— uniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in the range of [a,b).lyt returns the floating point number\\n— normalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where the mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is\\nused for standard deviation.\\n— The Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent multiple random number generators.\\nWrite a program to show the singleton pattern used in python.\\nSingleton patter is used to provide a mechanism that limits the number of instances that can be used by one class. It also\\nallows the same object to be shared between many different parts of the code. This allows the global variables to be used as\\nthe actual data that is used is hidden by the singleton class interface. The singleton class interface can have only one public\\nmember and one class method Handle. Private constructors are not used to creating an object that is used outside the class.\\nThe process waits for the static member function to create new instances and return the singleton object.\\n\n",

Consequently, if the Python code references a user -a defined function that does not exist,\\nthe code will compile successfully.

To load the web page, use the “requests” module.\\nparse HTML from the web page to find interesting information. Python has few modules for scraping the web. They are\\nurllib2, scrapy, pyquery, BeautifulSoap, etc.\\n\n",

For example, if x is a property\\nof a user-defined class, then the class would have methods called setX() and getX(). Python has an @property “decorator”\\nthat allows you to ad getters and setters in order to access the attribute of the class.\\n\n",

We can iterate on the generator object using the\\nkeyword. But we can only do that once because their values don't persist in memory, they get the values on the fly.\\nGenerators give us the ability to hold the execution of a function or a step as long as we want to keep it. However, here are a\\nfew examples where it is beneficial to use generators.\\nWe can replace loops with generators for efficiently calculating results involving large data sets.\\nGenerators are useful when we don’t want all the results and wish to hold back for some time.\\nInstead of using a callback function, we can replace it with a generator. We can write a loop inside the function doing the\\nsame thing as the callback and turns it into a generator.\\n\n",

The method is defined as:\\n1.import random\\n2.random.random\\nThe statement random.random() method return the floating point number that is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates\\n\\nrandom float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the hidden instances.\\nThe instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading programs that create a different instance of individual\\nthreads. The other random generators that are used in this are:\\nrandrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and defines the range in-between [a, b). It returns the elements by selecting them\\nrandomly from the range that is specified. It doesn’t build a range object.\\nuniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in the range of [a,b).lyt returns the floating point number\\nnormalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where the mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is used\\nfor standard deviation.\\nThe Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent multiple random number generators.\\n\n",

They support (fairly) efficient insertion, deletion, appending,\\nand concatenation, and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to construct and manipulate.\\nThey have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized” operations like elementwise addition and multiplication, and the\\nfact that they can contain objects of differing types mean that Python must store type information for every element, and\\nmust execute type dispatching code when operating on each element.\\nNumPy is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. You get a lot of vector and matrix operations for free, which\\nsometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary work. And they are also efficiently implemented.\\nNumPy array is faster and you get a lot built-in with NumPy, FFTs, convolutions, fast searching, basic statistics, linear algebra,\\nhistograms, etc.\\n\n",

So the heap holds all the Python objects and the data structures.\\nThis area is only accessible to the Python interpreter; programmers can't use it.\\nAnd it's the Python memory manager that handles the Private heap. It does the required allocation of the heap for Python\\nobjects.\\nPython employs a built-in garbage collector, which salvages all the unused memory and offloads it to the heap space.\\n\\n\\n\n"

Answer: In Python, every name introduced has a place where resides and can be found. This space is known as a\\nnamespace. It is an address location where a variable name is mapped to the object placed. Whenever the variable is\\nsearched out, this address location will be searched, to get the corresponding object.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: Both .py and .pyc files hold the byte code. “.pyc” is a compiled version of Python file. This file is automatically\\ngenerated by Python to improve performance.

Answer: Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and\\nconsist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the\\nother hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: Use the standard library module smtplib. Here’s a very simple interactive mail sender that uses it. This method will\\nwork on any host that supports an SMTP listener.\\n\\nimport sys, smtplib\\n\\nfromaddr = raw_input(“From: “)\\n\\ntoaddrs = raw_input(\"To: “).split(,’)\\n\fprint “Enter message, end with *D:”\\n\\nmsg =\"\\n\\nwhile 1:\\n\\nline = sys.stdin.readline()\\n\\nif not line:\\n\\nbreak\\n\\nmsg = msg + line\\n\\n# The actual mail sends\\n\\nserver = smtplib.SMTP(‘localhost’)\\nserver.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg)\\n\\nserver.quit()\\n\\nA UNIX-only alternative uses to send mail. The location of the send mail program varies between systems; sometimes it is\\n/usr/lib/sendmail, sometime /usr/sbin/sendmail. The send mail manual page will help you out. Here’s some sample code:\\nSENDMAIL = “/usr/sbin/sendmail” # sendmail location\\nimport os\\n\\np = os.popen(“%s -t -i” % SENDMAIL, “w”)\\n\\np.write(“To: receiver@example.comn\")\\np.write(“Subject: testn”)\\n\\np.write(“n’) # blank line separating headers from body\\np.write(“Some textn”)\\n\\np.write(“some more textn”)\\n\\nsts = p.close()\\n\\nif sts != 0:\\n\\nprint “Sendmail exit status”, sts\\n\\n\n",

Answer: As soon as the main thread exits, all threads are killed.

Answer: In Python, by default, all the parameters (arguments) are passed “by reference” to the functions. Thus, if you change\\nthe value of the parameter within a function, the change is reflected in the calling function. We can even observe the pass “by\\nvalue” kind of behavior whenever we pass the arguments to functions that are of type say numbers, strings, tuples. This is\\nbecause of the immutable nature of them.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: By default python interpreter search for the imported modules in the following locations:\\n\\nCurrent directory (main module location)\\n\\nEnvironment variable path\\n\\nInstallation dependent directory\\n\\nIf the imported module is not found in any one of the above locations. Then python interpreter gives an error.\\n\\nBuilt-in attributes of a module:\\n\\nBy default for each and every python module some properties are added internally and we call those properties as a built-in-\\n\\nattribute of a module.

Answer: The sequences in python are indexed and it consists of the positive as well as negative numbers. The numbers that\\nare positive uses ‘0’ that is used as the first index and ‘1’ as the second index and the process goes on like that. The index for\\nthe negative number starts from ‘-1’ that represents the last index in the sequence and ‘-2’ as the penultimate index and the\\nsequence carries forward like the positive number. The negative index is used to remove any new-line spaces from the string\\nand allow the string to except the last character that is given as S[:-1]. The negative index is also used to show the index to\\nrepresent the string in the correct order.\\n\\nWrite a program to check whether the object is of a class or its subclass.\\n\\nThere is a method which is built-in to show the instances of an object that consists of many classes by providing a tuple in a\\n\\ntable instead of individual classes. The method is given as isinstance(obj,cls) and in more details given as:\\n\\nisinstance(obj, (class1, class2, ...)) that is used to check about the object's presence in one of the classes. The built in types\\n\\ncan also have many formats of the same function like isinstance(obj, str) or isinstance(obj, (int, long, float, complex)).\\n\\nIt is not preferred to use the class instead of user-defined classes are made that allow easy object-oriented style to define the\\nbehavior of the object's class. These perform a different thing that is based on the class. The function differs from one class\\nto another class.\\n\\nTo find out the object of the particular class the following program is used:\\n\fdef search(obj):\\n\\nif isinstance(obj, box):\\n\\n# This is the code that is given for the box and writes the program in the object\\nelif isinstance(obj, Document):\\n\\n# This is the code that searches the document and writes the values in it\\n\\nelif\\n\\nobj.search()\\n\\n#This is the function used to search the object's class.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: “Self” is a variable that represents the instance of the object to itself. In most of the object-oriented programming\\nlanguage, this is passed as to the methods as a hidden parameter that is defined by an object. But, in python, it is declared it\\nand pass it explicitly. It is the first argument that gets created in the instance of class A and the parameters to the methods\\nare passed automatically. It refers to a separate instance of the variable for individual objects. This is the first argument that\\nis used in the class instance and the “self” method is defined explicitly to all the methods that are used and present. The\\n\\nvariables are referred to as “self.xxx\".\\n\\n\n",

Answer: The popen2() module is used to run the sub-process but due to some difficulty in processing like the creation of\\ndeadlock that keeps a process blocked that wait for the output from the child and child is waiting for the input. The deadlock\\noccurs due to the fact that parent and child don’t have the synchronization and both are waiting to get the processor to\\nprovide the resources to one another. Use of popen3() method allows the reading of stdout and stderr to take place where\\nthe internal buffer increases and there is no read() takes place to share the resources. popen2() take care of the deadlock by\\nproviding the methods like wait() and waitpid() that finishes a process first and when a request comes it hands over the\\nresponsibility to the process that is waiting for the resources.\\n\\nThe program is used to show the process and run it.\\n\\nimport popen2\\n\\nfromchild, tochild = popen2.popen2(“command”)\\n\\ntochild.write(“inputn”)\\n\\ntochild.flush()\\n\\noutput = fromchild.readline()\\n\\nTop 54 Python Interview Questions And Answers For Experienced\\n\\n\n",

Answer: The random module is the standard module that is used to generate a random number.\\n\\nThe method is defined as:\\n\\nimport random\\n\\n.random()\\n\\nThe statement random.random() method return the floating point number that is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates\\nrandom float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the hidden instances.\\nThe instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading programs that create a different instance of individual\\nthreads. The other random generators that are used in this are:\\n\\n— randrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and defines the range in-between [a, b). It returns the elements by selecting them\\nrandomly from the range that is specified. It doesn't build a range object.\\n\\n— uniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in the range of [a,b).lyt returns the floating point number\\n\\n— normalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where the mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is\\nused for standard deviation.\\n\\n— The Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent multiple random number generators.\\n\\nWrite a program to show the singleton pattern used in python.\\n\\nSingleton patter is used to provide a mechanism that limits the number of instances that can be used by one class. It also\\nallows the same object to be shared between many different parts of the code. This allows the global variables to be used as\\nthe actual data that is used is hidden by the singleton class interface. The singleton class interface can have only one public\\nmember and one class method Handle. Private constructors are not used to creating an object that is used outside the class.\\nThe process waits for the static member function to create new instances and return the singleton object.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: There are 4 different methods in the “re” module to perform pattern matching. They are:\\n\\nmatch() — matches the pattern only to the beginning of the String. search() - scan the string and look for a location the\\npattern matches findall() — finds all the occurrences of the match and return them as a list\\n\\nfinder() — finds all the occurrences of match and return them as an iterator.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: Python performs some amount of compile-time checking, but most of the checks such as type, name, etc are\\npostponed until code execution. Consequently, if the Python code references a user -a defined function that does not exist,\\nthe code will compile successfully. In fact, the code will fail with an exception only when the code execution path references\\n\\nthe function which does not exist.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: Accessors and mutators are often called getters and setters in languages like “Java”. For example, if x is a property\\nof a user-defined class, then the class would have methods called setX() and getX().

Answer: The 3 magic methods of Python that are used in the construction and initialization of custom Objects are: init_, new,\\nand del_.\\n\\nnew - this method can be considered as a “constructor”. It is invoked to create an instance of a class with the statement\\nsaid, myObj = MyClass()\\n\finit_ — It is an “initializer\"/ “constructor” method. It is invoked whenever any arguments are passed at the time of creating an\\nobject. myObj = MyClass(‘Pizza’,25)\\ndel- this method is a “destructor” of the class.

Answer: A generator in Python is a function which returns an iterable object. We can iterate on the generator object using the\\nkeyword. But we can only do that once because their values don't persist in memory, they get the values on the fly.\\n\\nGenerators give us the ability to hold the execution of a function or a step as long as we want to keep it. However, here are a\\nfew examples where it is beneficial to use generators.\\n\\nWe can replace loops with generators for efficiently calculating results involving large data sets.\\nGenerators are useful when we don’t want all the results and wish to hold back for some time.\\nInstead of using a callback function, we can replace it with a generator.

Answer: To modify the strings, Python's “re” module is providing 3 methods. They are:\\n\\nsplit) - uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list.\\nsub() — finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then replace them with a different string\\nsubn() - it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along with the no. of replacements\\n\\n\n",

Answer: The random module is the standard module that is used to generate a random number. The method is defined as:\\n\\n1.import random\\n2.random.random\\n\\nThe statement random.random() method return the floating point number that is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates\\n\frandom float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the hidden instances.\\nThe instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading programs that create a different instance of individual\\nthreads. The other random generators that are used in this are:\\n\\nrandrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and defines the range in-between [a, b). It returns the elements by selecting them\\nrandomly from the range that is specified. It doesn’t build a range object.\\n\\nuniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in the range of [a,b).lyt returns the floating point number\\nnormalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where the mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is used\\nfor standard deviation.\\n\\nThe Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent multiple random number generators.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: Python's lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They support (fairly) efficient insertion, deletion, appending,\\nand concatenation, and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to construct and manipulate.\\n\\nThey have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized” operations like elementwise addition and multiplication, and the\\nfact that they can contain objects of differing types mean that Python must store type information for every element, and\\nmust execute type dispatching code when operating on each element.\\n\\nNumPy is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. You get a lot of vector and matrix operations for free, which\\nsometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary work. And they are also efficiently implemented.\\n\\nNumPy array is faster and you get a lot built-in with NumPy, FFTs, convolutions, fast searching, basic statistics, linear algebra,\\nhistograms, etc.\\n\\n\n",

Answer: Python uses private heaps to maintain its memory. So the heap holds all the Python objects and the data structures.\\nThis area is only accessible to the Python interpreter; programmers can't use it.\\n\\nAnd it's the Python memory manager that handles the Private heap. It does the required allocation of the heap for Python\\nobjects.\\n\\nPython employs a built-in garbage collector, which salvages all the unused memory and offloads it to the heap space.\\n\f\n"
